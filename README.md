# My Movies Application

This Flutter application demonstrates a movie list with individual  details for each movie.

## Architectural Choices

### State Management
- **`GetX`**:
    - Handles reactive state management, dependency injection, and routing.
    - Reduces boilerplate while improving code maintainability.

### Modular Design
- Divided into controllers and views for better separation of concerns:
    - **`MovieListView`**: Displays the list of Movie.
    - **`MovieDetailView`**: Shows detailed information about a selected Movie.
    - **`FavouriteList`**: Manages individual post timers, ensuring that timers work independently.

### Timer Management
- The timer system ensures:
    - Each post has its own timer.
    - Only the timer for the clicked post pauses, while others continue running.
    - Timers resume when the user navigates back to the list.

## Third-Party Libraries

1. **`http`**
    - Handles API requests for fetching post data.

2. **`get`**
    - Provides state management, dependency injection, and navigation.
    - Simplifies app development by offering a single, unified approach.

3. **`visibility_detector`**
    - Monitors the visibility of list items (posts) to start or pause timers dynamically based on visibility.

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Android Studio, VS Code, or any preferred IDE

   flutter run

## Application Features

### Post List:
- Displays a list of posts, each with its own independent timer.
- When a post is clicked, its timer pauses, while the timers for other posts continue running.
- When navigating back to the post list, the paused timer for the clicked post resumes from where it left off.

### Post Details:
- Shows the detailed view of a selected post.
- The timer for the post pauses when the user clicks on it and resumes correctly when navigating back, ensuring the timer state is preserved across screens.

### Independent Timers:
- Each post has a dedicated timer.
- Only the timer of the clicked post pauses, while other timers continue running in the background.
